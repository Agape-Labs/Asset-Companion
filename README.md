Scan any webpage and discover all on-page images—preview, filter, and download them individually or in a single click. Batch downloads are neatly organized into folders named after the site’s domain.

3. Font Detector:
Instantly see which fonts are used on any page. Copy font names with one click.

4. Color Palette & Picker:
Grab dominant site colors as a swatch grid—or use the powerful color picker to sample any color pixel from the page, then copy the HEX code to your clipboard.

5. Screenshot Tool:
Capture a screenshot of the entire page or specific sections (PNG/PDF) for reference and inspiration.

6. Right-Click Unlock:
Regain your browser’s full context menu and copy/paste ability on sites that restrict user interaction.
