## About The Project

Asset Companion launches as a lightweight, always-available sidebar panel, giving you a powerful suite of tools to deconstruct and collect web assets without cluttering your page. It's designed to supercharge your creative workflow by eliminating the need to manually dig through source code.

This tool is perfect for:
*   Graphic & UI/UX designers
*   Web developers & frontend engineers
*   Researchers & brand/marketing teams
*   Content creators and anyone gathering design assets or inspiration

### Built With
*   JavaScript (ES6+)
*   HTML5 & CSS3
*   Manifest V3

## ðŸš€ Features

*   **Extract Images**: Scan any webpage to discover all on-page images. You can preview, filter (by size, type, or aspect ratio), and download them individually or all at once.
*   **Batch Image Downloader**: Instantly save all detected images from a website directly into a neatly organized subfolder named after the siteâ€™s domain (e.g., `Downloads/your-site.com/`).
*   **Font Detector**: Instantly identify all fonts used on a webpage and copy their names with one click.
*   **Color Palette & Picker**: Automatically generate a swatch grid of the dominant colors on a site. Use the powerful color picker to sample any pixel and copy its HEX code to your clipboard.
*   **Screenshot Tool**: Capture a screenshot of the entire page or a specific section, saving it as a PNG or PDF for reference and inspiration.
*   **Right-Click Unlock**: Regain your browserâ€™s full context menu and copy/paste abilities on sites that try to restrict user interaction.
*   **Instant Sidebar Interface**: A fast, always-on panel that provides immediate access to all tools without interfering with the webpage content.
